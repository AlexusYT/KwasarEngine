<h2>What is this page about?</h2>
<p>Developing a game engine, like any other software development process, is a very laborious task that requires time.
    Currently, the project is created, maintained, and improved by one person's efforts, which obviously isn't enough
    for rapid development. If you have the desire and ability to help, I would be happy to receive your
    contribution.</p>
<h2>I want to help but don't know how</h2>
<p>There are actually many options, it all depends on the person, their skills, and abilities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you are a C++ programmer, you can check the issues section of the repository for <a
            href="https://github.com/AlexusYT/MegaEngineRing/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug">bugs</a>
        or
        <a href="https://github.com/AlexusYT/MegaEngineRing/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adevelopment">development
            tasks</a>. Also, the file <a
                href="https://github.com/AlexusYT/MegaEngineRing/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#your-first-code-contribution">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>
        will be useful for you.
    </li>
    <li>If you are a tester, your task is to test the editor's interface and API of the engine, as well as their results
        (compiled games). Bug reports should be created <a
                href="https://github.com/AlexusYT/MegaEngineRing/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>If you are a game developer, we ask you to leave feedback and suggestions for improving the engine, its parts,
        and the editor <a href="https://github.com/AlexusYT/MegaEngineRing/issues">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>And if you've read this far and nothing seems suitable for you, that's okay. There is also a task for you: share
        this site with those who might be interested.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Thank you very much for your help to the project!</h2>
