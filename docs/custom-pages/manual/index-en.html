<h2 id="first-run">Introduction and first run</h2>
<p>At the current moment, there is no straightforward way to install the game engine on your computer. For now, this is
    not a big issue since the engine is in its early stages of development with limited functionality. Installation will
    require knowledge of the English language and the ability to build programs from source code. The installation
    instructions can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/AlexusYT/MegaEngineRing#-prerequisites">README.md</a>
    repository file.</p>
<p>The process of starting the program is also not very user-friendly: you need to open the directory where you
    installed the engine after building it. If you did not specify the installation path in step 2 above, then the
    directory will depend on your operating system: for Windows 10 and higher - this is <code>C:\Program
        Files\MegaEngineRing</code>, and for Linux/Ubuntu - this is <code>/usr/local/MegaEngineRing</code>. In this
    directory, you need to find the <code>bin</code> subdirectory, then the executable file
    <code>MegaEngineRing.exe</code> for Windows, or <code>MegaEngineRing</code> for Linux.</p>
<p>When running the executable on Windows, a window will open warning the user that this program is from an unknown
    publisher. <s>Right.</s> To continue, you need to click the "More info" button, after which a "Run anyway" button
    will appear at the bottom. Is it dangerous for the computer? As a developer of this application, I can assure you:
    "No, it's not." If you are unsure, you can check the program files with an online antivirus <a
            href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload">VirusTotal</a> or any other available to you.</p>
<p>After launching the program, the main window will appear:</p>

<h2 id="window-structure">Application Window Structure</h2>
<p>The window consists of workspaces (editors), which in turn consist of tools.</p>

<ul>
    <li>A tool is an element of the window that can be associated only with a specific type of workspace. You cannot
        move a scene editing tool to the import online workspace and vice versa. A tool performs a specific function
        within a workspace, for example, the <code>ViewObjectPropertiesTool</code> in the screenshot above is only
        responsible for configuring the selected object in the scene.
    </li>
    <li>A workspace (editor) is a set of tools associated with one meaning. In the screenshot above, the <code>Scene
        1</code> editor is responsible for editing the scene, to which are added tools such as
        <code>SceneEditorPreview</code> for previewing the scene and its editing results, <code>TreeViewTool</code> for
        displaying the scene objects in a tree structure, and <code>ViewObjectPropertiesTool</code> for configuring the
        selected object. For more details about editors, see the <a href="#workspace-list">List of Workspaces and
            Editors</a> section.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For editors, workspaces, and tools, there is interface customization available: they can be moved, detached,
    combined, opened, closed, etc. Try it out. To reset the customization settings, you need to delete the <code>imgui.ini</code>
    file located next to the executable file.</p>
